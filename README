 * climail : simple but powerful email access from your command line *
 ********************************************************************/

Hey, am just not in the mood to open a browser just to peek at what new 
messages I have in my inbox. And I also don't want peeking at this info
via some other sophisticaed gui-client like pidgin, digsby, etc No one
should know when am checking my mail!

So, for the fun, thrill and challenge of it, am making a climail client
for *us* all :-) Don't know whether I'll totally pull it off, but you
can join :-) And am putting this on git for *us* all!

----------------------------
With a working version of climail ready, check just how cool it is to check mail now:

Simple usage : ./climail.rb 

That is assuming you using gmail, and have specified imap_server,imap_port, etc in the conf.yaml in the same directory as climail

Flexible usage: ./climail.rb -u joe@jkfotis.com -f Work -c myconf.yaml

In all the above, climail will prompt you for a password, unless to explicitly (unsecure) specify it via commandline using 

./climail -p PASSWORD

For more options, use -h or --help, or read the source :-) and extend it too..

----------------------------
if you are a regular user of climail, u might want to create an alias command in your bashrc, so that u don't have to
recall, retype everything everytime. After setting their alias for climail to 'gmail', 
here is how someone is checking their unread mail right now:

mcnemesis@alien > gmail
