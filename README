/******************************************************************6**
 * climail : simple but powerful email access from your command line *
 ********************************************************************/

Hey, am just not in the mood to open a browser just to peek at what new 
messages I have in my inbox. And I also don't want peeking at this info
via some other sophisticaed gui-client like pidgin, digsby, etc No one
should know when am checking my mail!

So, for the fun, thrill and challenge of it, am making a climail client
for *us* all :-) Don't know whether I'll totally pull it off, but you
can join :-) And am putting this on git for *us* all!
