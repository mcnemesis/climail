 * climail : simple but powerful email access from your command line *
 ********************************************************************/

Hey, am just not in the mood to open a browser just to peek at what new 
messages I have in my inbox. And I also don't want peeking at this info
via some other sophisticaed gui-client like pidgin, digsby, etc No one
should know when am checking my mail!

So, for the fun, thrill and challenge of it, am making a climail client
for *us* all :-) Don't know whether I'll totally pull it off, but you
can join :-) And am putting this on git for *us* all!

----------------------------
With a working version of climail ready, check just how cool it is to check mail now:

Simple usage : ./climail.rb 

That is assuming you using gmail, and have specified imap_server,imap_port, etc in the conf.yaml in the same directory as climail

Flexible usage: ./climail.rb -u jo@jkfotis.com -f Work -c myconf.yaml

In all the above, climail will prompt you for a password, unless to explicitly (unsecure) specify it via commandline using 

./climail -p PASSWORD

For more options, use -h or --help, or read the source :-) and extend it too..

----------------------------
if you are a regular user of climail, u might want to create an alias command in your bashrc, so that u don't have to
recall, retype everything everytime. After setting their alias for climail to 'gmail', 
here is how someone is checking their unread mail right now:

mcnemesis@alien > gmail

isn't that cool?!
I love Ruby :-)

***************************
QUICK TIPS:
1. climail requires Ruby to be installed on yo machine 
 (get ruby here : www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/, or use yo package manager on Linux to get it )
2. you need to have RubyGems installed too -  we need it to install "highline" a required gem
 (get RubyGems here : rubygems.org/pages/download)

NOTE : the above two packages are very likely to already exist on a typical Linux / Unix box

3. install the highline gem with this command on your terminal

 gem install highline

4. edit "conf.yaml" to set any different settings u have, in particular, set the "username" field to say your gmail username
  (incase u dont want to out the username in the conf.yaml file, u'll have to specify it via the commandline with the "-u" option, or some given prompt)

After the above, you are ready to rock!

BONUS TRICK:

(unsafe though if someonelse gets access to yo computer)
1. how to use climail by just typing "gmail" at the commandline!
    1. open your bashrc file (e.g /etc/bash.bashrc)
    2. add an alias command "gmail" like this:

    alias gmail="/path/to/your/climail.rb -p your_password_here -c /path/to/your/conf.yaml"

    3. You might have to add in a "sudo" before the climail.rb part on some systems

    alias gmail="sudo /path/to/your/climail.rb -p your_password_here -c /path/to/your/conf.yaml"

    4. ok, so how do u use this? In any new terminal / shell, type "gmail" (see earlier demo above)
